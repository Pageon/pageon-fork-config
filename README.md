# Sumo specific Fork stuff

Fork CMS is great, we use it all the time for client-projects. But we also
like our internal tools.

So this codebase will tie in our internal tools into Fork CMS for the sites we
create for our clients.

## SlackWebhookMonolog

Instead of the default error handeling in Fork errors will be send to our slack channel so our dev's will be notified.

We will also display a nice error message for the customers.
